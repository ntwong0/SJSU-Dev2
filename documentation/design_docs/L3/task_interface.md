# Location
`L3 Application`

# Type
Interface

# Background
The `Task` interface is an abstraction layer for FreeRTOS tasks.

Information regarding FreeRTOS tasks can be found
[here](https://www.freertos.org/a00015.html).

# Overview
Tasks that are scheduled and managed by the
[`TaskScheduler`](/documentation/design_docs/L3/task_scheduler.md).
Task objects must inherit the `Task` interface.

# Detailed Design
## API

```

## Static Allocation of Tasks
Tasks are statically allocated and the FreeRTOS task handle is created and
managed by the `TaskScheduler`. To enable the static allocation of tasks, the
`configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION` definition is set to 1 in
[FreeRTOSConfig.h](/library/L0_Platform/freertos/FreeRTOSConfig.h) and the
implementation of `vApplicationGetIdleTaskMemory()` must also be provided to
statically allocate memory for the FreeRTOS idle task when
`vTaskStartScheduler()` is invoked.

> **Note:** Static allocation for FreeRTOS is enabled by default in SJSU-Dev2.

```c++
static StaticTask_t idle_task_tcb;
static StackType_t idle_task_stack[configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE];
extern "C" void vApplicationGetIdleTaskMemory(
    StaticTask_t ** ppx_idle_task_tcb_buffer,
    StackType_t ** ppx_idle_task_stack_buffer,
    uint32_t * pul_idle_task_stack_size)
{
  *ppx_idle_task_tcb_buffer   = &idle_task_tcb;
  *ppx_idle_task_stack_buffer = idle_task_stack;
  *pul_idle_task_stack_size   = std::size(idle_task_stack);
}
```

More information regarding static allocation of FreeRTOS objects can be found
[here](https://www.freertos.org/a00110.html#configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION).

## Initialization
```c++
bool DeclaredOnStack()
```
The `DeclaredOnStack()` method checks if the address position of the `Task`
object is within the bounds of the heap or the .bss and data segments. A fatal
error is asserted if the tasks exists on the stack.

```c++
explicit constexpr Task(const char * name,
                        Priority priority,
                        TaskSchedulerInterface & task_scheduler);
```
The following is performed when the task is constructed:
1. Store the specified name, priority, and designated `TaskScheduler`.
2. Set the initial delay time to 0.
3. Invoke `DeclaredOnStack()` to check the task exists in the heap or is
   declared globally.
4. Add the task to the specified `task_scheduler`. This scheduler will be
   responsible for creating and managing this task.

## Inheriting the Task Interface class
When a task begins, the methods Setup(), PreRun(), and Run() are invoked in
the following order:
1. Setup()
2. PreRun()
3. Run()

These methods should be overridden in the inheriting class to provide any
initialization and/or execution code that are performed by the task.

```c++
void Setup() override
```
Setup is performed when `Start()` of the TaskScheduler is invoked. If the
`Setup()` of a scheduler task fails to complete, the scheduler will not start
and a fatal error will be asserted. The function should be overridden with any
initialization code that the task requires.

```c++
void PreRun() override
```
PreRun() is invoked after starting the task scheduler once before `Run()` is
ever called. `PreRun()` is performed after `Setup()` of all scheduled Tasks are
complete. Therefore, this method should be overridden if the task requires a
different `Task` to be setup first.

```c++
void Run() override
```
Continuously invoked until the task has been temporarily suspended by
`Suspend()` or terminated.

**The `Run()` method MUST be overridden with the desired task execution code.**

## Suspending and Resuming a Task
```c++
void Suspend() const override
```
Suspends the task until resumed by `Resume()`.

```c++
void Resume() const override
```
Resumes the task if the task was suspended by `Suspend()`.

## Removing a Task
```c++
void Delete() override
```
Suspends the task if it is running and invokes the `TaskScheduler`â€™s
`RemoveTask()` method to remove this task from the scheduler.

## Configuring Execution Frequency
A task can be configured to be executed at a constant desired frequency through
the `SetDelayTime()` function.

```c++
void SetDelayTime(uint32_t time) override
```
Sets the delay time in FreeRTOS ticks to ensure `Run()` is called at a desired
frequency for periodic tasks. For example, if time = 1000 and the rtos tick
period is 1ms, then `Run()` will be invoked every 1 second.

```c++
const uint32_t GetDelayTime() const override
```
Returns the delay time that was set by SetDelayTime() in milliseconds.

## Additional Utility Methods
```c++
const char * GetName() const override
```
Returns the name used to identify the task.

```c++
Priority GetPriority() const override
```
Returns the priority of the task.

```c++
size_t GetStackSize() const override
```
Returns the pre-allocated stack size for the task in bytes.

```c++
void SetHandle(TaskHandle_t * handle) override
```
This method is used by the `TaskScheduler` to set the task FreeRTOS task handle
when the task is created. This handle is used for suspending, resuming, or
deleting the task.

```c++
TaskHandle_t * GetHandle() override
```
Returns a pointer reference of the task's handle.

```c++
StaticTask_t * GetTaskBuffer() override
```
Returns a pointer reference to the task's Task Control Block (TCB);

```c++
StackType_t * GetStack() override
```
Returns a pointer reference of the task's pre-allocated stack.

# Caveats
The `TaskInterface` class is used to provide a generalization for the `Task`
class since the `Task` class takes in a template argument.
