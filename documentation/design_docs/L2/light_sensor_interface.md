# Location
`L2_HAL`.

# Type
Interface

# Background
Light sensors typically use photo-detectors to measure the amount of light in a
environment. The SI unit used is lux.

# Overview
The interface should be inherited by light sensing drivers.

# Detailed Design
## API
```c++
namespace sjsu
{
class LightSensor
{
 public:
  virtual Status Initialize() const                           = 0;
  virtual units::illuminance::lux_t GetIlluminance() const    = 0;
  virtual float GetPercentageBrightness() const               = 0;
  units::illuminance::lux_t GetMaxIlluminance() const = 0;
};
}  // namespace sjsu
```

## Initialization
```c++
virtual Status Initialize() const
```
Performs the necessary initialization sequence to initializes the driver for use
and returns the initialization status.

## Obtaining Sensor Readings
```c++
virtual units::illuminance::lux_t GetIlluminance() const
```
Returns the sensor reading in units of lux.

```c++
virtual units::illuminance::lux_t GetMaxIlluminance() const
```
Returns the maximum illuminance that can be detected by the device.

```c++
float GetPercentageBrightness() const
```
Returns the detected brightness as a percentage ranging from 0.0f to 1.0f.
The percentage is determined with the following equation:

percentage = value รท (max illuminance)
