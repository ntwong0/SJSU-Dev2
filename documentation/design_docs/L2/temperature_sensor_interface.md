# Location
`L2_HAL`.

# Type
Interface

# Background
An abstract interface for temperature sensing device drivers.

# Overview
The interface should be inherited by device drivers that are responsible for
obtaining temperature readings.

# Detailed Design
## API
```c++
namespace sjsu
{
class TemperatureSensor
{
 public:
  virtual Status Initialize() const = 0;
  virtual Status GetTemperature(
      units::temperature::celsius_t * temperature) const = 0;
};
}  // namespace sjsu
```

## Initialization
```c++
virtual Status Initialize() const
```
Performs the necessary initialization sequence to initializes the driver for use
and returns the initialization status.

## Obtaining Sensor Readings
```c++
virtual Status GetTemperature(
    units::temperature::celsius_t * temperature) const
```
Retrieves the temperature reading and writes the value to the designated memory
address.
