`L2_HAL`.

Implementation

# Background
The Tmp102 utilizes I2C for communication and is capable of measuring
temperatures ranging between -40˚C and +125˚C. A maximum of four sensors can be
used simultaneously. The device’s serial bus address is configurable by
connecting the address pin to one of four available connections.

The data-sheet for the device can be found
[here](/datasheets/sjone/Temperature/tmp102.pdf).

# Overview
Communication with the device uses typical I2C. Temperature data is obtained in
degrees Celsius and data bytes are transmitted with the most significant bytes
first.

# Detailed Design
## API
```C++
namespace sjsu
{
class Tmp102 final : public TemperatureSensor
{
 public:
  struct DeviceAddress
  {
   public:
    static constexpr uint8_t kGround      = 0b100'1000;
    static constexpr uint8_t kVoltageHigh = 0b100'1001;
    static constexpr uint8_t kSda         = 0b100'1010;
    static constexpr uint8_t kScl         = 0b100'1011;
  };

  struct RegisterAddress
  {
   public:
    static constexpr uint8_t kTemperature   = 0x00;
    static constexpr uint8_t kConfiguration = 0x01;
  };

  static constexpr uint8_t kOneShotShutdownMode = 0x81;
  static constexpr std::chrono::milliseconds kConversionTimeout = 30ms;

  explicit constexpr Tmp102(
      sjsu::I2c & i2c,
      uint8_t device_address = sjsu::Tmp102::DeviceAddress::kGround);
  Status Initialize() const override;
  Status GetTemperature(
      units::temperature::celsius_t * temperature) const override;

 private:
  void OneShotShutdown() const;

  const sjsu::I2c & i2c_;
  const uint8_t kDeviceAddress;
};
}  // namespace sjsu
```

## Device Address Configuration
The device address can be configured by connecting the address pin, A0, to
either GND, V+, SDA, or SCL. This allows up to four Tmp102 devices to be used
simultaneously.

| **Device Address** | **A0 Pin Connection** |
|:------------------:|:---------------------:|
|     0b100'1000     |         Ground        |
|     0b100'1001     |           V+          |
|     0b100'1010     |          SDA          |
|     0b100'1011     |          SCL          |

## Initialization
```c++
explicit constexpr Tmp102(
    sjsu::I2c & i2c,
    uint8_t device_address = sjsu::Tmp102::DeviceAddress::kGround);
```
Constructs the driver object
```c++
Status Initialize() const override
```
Initializes the `I2c` peripheral and returns the initialization status.

## Obtaining Temperature Readings
The device is configured for one-shot shutdown mode when taking temperature
readings to conserve power. That is, the device will take the temperature
reading once and then shutdown until another reading is requested. Each reading
requires a typical conversion time of 26µs.

```c++
static constexpr uint8_t kOneShotShutdownMode = 0x81;

void OneShotShutdown() const;
```
Writes the one-shot shutdown command to the configuration register to read the
temperature once and then shutdown the device. The temperature reading can then
be obtained from the temperature register.

```c++
Status GetTemperature(
    units::temperature::celsius_t * temperature) const override;
```
Returns the temperature reading in degrees Celsius.

# Testing Plan
## Unit Testing Scheme
An `I2c` driver shall be mocked and injected to the driver.

The following functions will be tested:
- Initialize()
  - Should return `Status::kSuccess`.
- GetTemperature()
  - The call count of the `I2c` method `Transaction()` should be exactly `2`.

## Demonstration Project
A demonstration project using the LPC17xx platform can be found
[here](/demos/sjone/temperature_sensor/source/main.cpp).
